**CS3141 Team Software Project**

A highly configurable JSON editor catered towards Minecraft sound_definition files. 
The purpose of the project is to allow users to easily create lengthy (thousands of lines long) JSON files without
having to learn about the required format for Minecraft. In addition the project can be used to generate changelogs 
for sound_definitions and document these changes in an online database for access anywhere.
